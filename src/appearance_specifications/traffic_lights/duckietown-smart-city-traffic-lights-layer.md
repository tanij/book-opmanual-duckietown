# Infrastructure - Traffic Lights

Duckietown traffic lights are more than just blinking lights: they are static robots. Often referred to as "Duckiebots without wheels," they share many capabilities with the `DB18` Duckiebot models, minus the ability to move.

Traffic lights are urban robots equipped to:
- **Sense**: Detect the arrival of a Duckiebot using a camera.
- **Compute**: Perform onboard processing with a Raspberry Pi.
- **Communicate**: Signal other agents through LEDs and connect via Wi-Fi.

```{tip}
(For advanced Duckietowners only) Traffic lights are specialized cases of Duckietown Watchtowers, i.e., Watchtowers with LEDs. Watchtowers form the foundation of Duckietown Autolabs.

## Placement

Traffic lights are typically positioned diagonally over intersection tiles. Any intersection in Duckietown can host a traffic light.

```{note}
The lights must be installed at a height of 20 cm above the center of the intersection tile.
```

The computational stack is mounted in the appropriate housing and positioned outside the allowable driving region. The cables are integrated into the traffic light structure, as detailed in the [assembly instructions](specs-layer-traffic-lights-assembly). 

Traffic light pillars must be positioned so that the embedded traffic signs adhere to the [appearance specifications](traffic-signs-placement).
