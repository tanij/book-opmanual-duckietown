# Traffic Signs - Street Name Signs

```{attention}
The traffic sign type described here is experimental. Use at your own risk!
```

Street name signs are **non-functional** elements, meaning they are not integrated into any Duckiebot behavior. However, they add an aesthetic and outreach element to Duckietown, making the city more engaging and visually appealing.

```{tip}
Consider naming the main avenue in your Duckietown after someone significant in your community, like your Department Head or a local robotics advocate.
```
