# Assembly - (Legacy) Traffic Light `DT18-TL`

```{needget}
* You have the components of a `DT18-TL` model traffic light. If not, you can get one from the Duckietown project store: [Get Duckietown Traffic Light DT18-TL](https://get.duckietown.com/products/duckietown-smart-traffic-light-dt18-tl) section.

## Assembly of the Traffic Light Parts

This section provides step-by-step instructions for assembling the components of the laser-cut traffic light parts.

```{warning}
The small parts with holes in the middle, as shown on the left of {numref}`fig:G-1`, are not identical. Some have round holes, while others have polygonal holes. Double-check to ensure you are using the correct parts during assembly (compare with the pictures).
```

For enhanced structural stability, all parts should be glued together as shown in the images.

## Components of the Traffic Light

After assembling the traffic light chassis, you can proceed to add the electronics.

```{figure} ../../_images/assembly/traffic_light_18/TL-01.jpg
:width: 80%
:name: fig:tl_components

Parts needed to complete these instructions.
```

Required components for one traffic light:
- Tube holder with big ground plate
- Tube holder with small ground plate (Duckietown)
- Cable with soldered LED strip
- Joint module (2x)
- Traffic light LED housing
- Raspberry Pi base plate
- Ground module cover (Duckietown)
- Camera mount and cover
- Tubes (short, medium, long with side hole)
- Raspberry Pi and shield
- M2.5x10 MF Nylon spacers (8x)
- M2.5x8 Nylon screws (4x)
- SD card with Duckietown software
- USB and Ethernet cables

Additional optional components:
- Traffic sign stands (4x)
- Traffic sign stand supports (4x)

## Fully Assembled Traffic Light

Once fully assembled, position the traffic light at an intersection. Ensure:
- LEDs face each incoming lane perpendicularly.
- Duckiebots at red stop lines see only one light blinking, with no reflections of other LEDs.

Use double-sided tape pads to securely attach the traffic light to the tiles.
