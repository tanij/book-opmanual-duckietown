# Assembly - Traffic Light

```{needget}
*   Traffic light components ([Duckietown project shop](https://get.duckietown.com/products/smart-traffic-light?variant=32311801413771))

*   An appropriately [configured SD-card](book-opmanual-duckiebot:setup-duckiebot-sd-card).

*   Tools: (strong) wood glue or hot glue gun, tape, double-sided tape.
---
*   An assembled traffic light in configuration `DT21-TL` (latest) or previous legacy versions.
```

This section describes the physical assembly and installation of traffic lights.

## Overview

Traffic lights are crucial elements of modern cities, and in Duckietown, they play a similar role by ensuring well-organized traffic. 

They can serve as:
1. Centralized coordinators of traffic at 3- or 4-way intersections in Duckietown.
2. Components of a Duckietown Autolab watchtower network.

```{attention}
For Duckiebots to recognize traffic lights governing a specific intersection, appropriate signage must be placed (traffic light traffic sign instead of a stop sign).
```

- **Hardware Design**: Traffic lights are "Duckiebots without wheels," housed in a distinct chassis.
- **Structure**: They consist of two supports connected by an overhanging tube, with one support containing the computational stack and an overseeing camera.
- **Placement**: Traffic lights are positioned diagonally at intersections.

## Hardware Assembly

- For **latest** configuration traffic lights, refer to the instructions:
  * [](traffic-light-assembly-21)
- For legacy builds (prior to `TL21`), follow these instructions:
  * [](traffic-light-assembly-18).

### SD-card Image Preparation

At the software level, traffic lights function similarly to Duckiebots. When initializing the SD-card, follow the instructions [here](book-opmanual-duckiebot:setup-duckiebot-sd-card), ensuring you use the `--type traffic_light` option.

Wi-Fi configuration for traffic lights is not set by default. To enable it, use the `--wifi` option as described in the [instructions](book-opmanual-duckiebot:setup-duckiebot-sd-card).

Example command for a Wi-Fi connected traffic light:

```shell
dts init_sd_card --hostname watchtowerXX --country COUNTRY --type traffic_light --configuration TL21
```

```{note}
For Autolab users: Use the convention `hostname: watchtowerXX`, where `XX` are incremental numbers.
```
- For standard traffic light setup, use:
    *   `hostname: trafficlightXX`

- Default login credentials:
    *   Username: `duckie`
    *   Password: `quackquack`

```{warning}
For Autolab users, do not change the username and password.
```

### Launch Traffic Lights

By setting the `robot_type` to `traffic_light`, blinking behavior will start automatically on boot.

To restart the traffic light behavior manually, run the following inside the `duckiebot-interface` container:

```shell
roslaunch duckiebot_interface all_drivers.launch veh:=NAME robot_type:=traffic_light
```

Semantics of LEDS {#LED-semantics status=draft}

headlights: white, constant

Assumption:

- **20 fps** to do LED detection

- 1s to decide

- 3 frequencies to detect

tail lights: red, **6 hz square wave**

traffic light "GO" = green, **1 hz square wave**

traffic light "STOP" = red, **1.5 Hz** square wave**

duckie light on top, state 0 = off

duckie light on top, state 1 = blue, **3 Hz, square wave**

duckie light on top, state 2 = ?, **2.5 Hz square wave**

duckie light on top, state 3 = ?, **2 Hz square wave**

verify if this info is still up to date.
